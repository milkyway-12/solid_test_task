# Solid Test Task - Random Color Generator App With Creating Unique Abstract Art Pictures

## Overview
This is a Flutter test project demonstrating a simple app with a button that changes the screen's background color. Additionally, it generates a small abstract art widget from the chosen colors, which can be shared using the system share dialog.

## Features
- **Change Background Color:** Press the button to generate a random color for the screen background.
- **Generate Art:** Each color added creates a new element in the art widget.
- **Share Art:** Share the generated abstract art as an image using the system share dialog.
- **Clean Architecture:** The project follows clean architecture principles with `domain`, `data`, and `presentation` layers.
- **Cubit State Management:** Uses `flutter_bloc` to manage state changes.
